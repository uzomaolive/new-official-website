# I started out as a WordPress designer, and honestly?

I didn’t have much desire to learn how to code.

I loved the creativity of WordPress — being able to build beautiful websites with themes and page builders. But the more I explored, the more I hit a wall. I’d see a design in my head… but without knowing basic code, I couldn’t tweak things exactly how I wanted.

That frustration slowly turned into curiosity. I started learning bits of **HTML** and **CSS** — just enough to change margins, fix layout issues, or style a button the way I envisioned. Then came more advanced things like **child themes**, **custom post types**, and **plugins**. Before I knew it, I was deep in the world of frontend development, exploring tools like **Tailwind CSS**, **Docker**, and even **Bedrock** for professional WordPress setups.

I never thought I’d become a *developer*, but now I can say:

- 👩🏾‍💻 **I write code** 
- 🛠️ I build solutions  
- 💡 I make WordPress do what I want — not the other way around.

And I’m still learning every day.

If you're just starting out with WordPress and feel like coding isn't “your thing” — I get it. But don’t be afraid to explore. The ability to **create without limits** is one of the best things about tech.
