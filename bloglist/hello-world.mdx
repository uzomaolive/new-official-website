# I started out as a WordPress designer, and honestly?
I didn’t have much desire to learn how to code.

I loved the creativity of WordPress — being able to build beautiful websites with themes and page builders. But the more I explored, the more I hit a wall. I’d see a design in my head… but without knowing basic code, I couldn’t tweak things exactly how I wanted.
That frustration slowly turned into curiosity. I started learning bits of HTML and CSS — just enough to change margins, fix layout issues, or style a button the way I envisioned. Then came more advanced things like child themes, custom post types, and plugins. Before I knew it, I was deep in the world of frontend development, exploring tools like Tailwind CSS, Docker, and even Bedrock for professional WordPress setups.
